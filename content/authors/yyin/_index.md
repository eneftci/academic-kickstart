Yue Yin received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Carnegie Mellon University, respectively, both in Biomedical Engineering with a concentration on biomedical signal processing. He worked in industry shortly after undergraduate, some of his projects include automated analyzer to process periodic waveforms (cardiac action potentials, calcium transients, and force contraction) for drug screening on cardiac tissue, 3D engineered heart tissue based high throughput assay system with automatic liquid handling, and computational simulation on iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to study drug-induced arrhythmia sensitivity. At CMU, he developed instrumented hip implant model to detect loosening using acoustic impedance analysis. Currently, as a member of NMI-lab, his research focuses on artificial neural network and machine learning.
